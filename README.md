# edna-expeditions

This is the technical documentation for the eDNA Expeditions project. Data processing for eDNA Expeditions is organized in a number of public GitHub repositories that are linked together as follows:

## Data access
### Site geometries

A geopackage with all site geometries is available at <https://github.com/iobis/mwhs-shapes>.

### Biodiversity data üê†

Data are available at different levels of data processing:

- **Raw sequence** data will be made available later.
- A selection of files are available straight from the bioinformatics pipeline at [pacman-pipeline-results](https://github.com/iobis/pacman-pipeline-results). This includes **vsearch results, RDP classifier results, and Darwin Core tables by site and marker**.
- These individual datasets are combined together with sample metadata into an **integrated Darwin Core dataset** available at [edna-results](https://github.com/iobis/edna-results).
- **Species lists by site from eDNA as well as OBIS/GBIF** are available at [edna-species-lists](https://github.com/iobis/edna-species-lists).

### Environmental data üå°Ô∏è 

To be added.
